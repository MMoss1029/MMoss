### Why hello there!

## You seem to have stumbled across my README, so here is a little bit about me
#(I have never used Github before so this is all brand new to me)

- I am currently a Computer Science major at Northampton Community College, and this Github account will be used to submit and complete assignments in my computer classes
- I grew up with video games, starting out with a Nintento gamecube and a wii to now having a PS4, WiiU, Nintendo Switch, and my own gaming desktop setup
- My favorite games include ROBLOX (Yes I am in college and still playing this), World of Tanks, Geometry Dash, Phasmophobia (In VR), and Beat Saber
- I have experience in coding languages that include Python, HTML (For website deisng), and now C++ which is my personal favorite
- Github seems like a huge step up from Replit, so im excited to see what it has in store for me!
